### 6. `git branch -d branch-name / git branch -D branch-name`

- The will delete the branch from local repository & later one will delete the branch forcefully as if it has not been merged then it can't be deleted.

### 7. `git push origin --delete branch-name`

- This will delete the branch from remote repository.

### 8. `git checkout main & git merge feature-branch`

- This will merge the feature branch with main. So on main branch we will have a merge commit. It contains all the code from feature-branch.
- This will merge the feature branch from local repository not with the remote feature branch. To get the latest from origin we can use either or two below
- `git pull origin feature-branch` => This will fetch the latest code from feature branch and merge it into current branch(main in our case)
