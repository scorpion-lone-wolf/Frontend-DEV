> ### 5. `git checkout -b branch-name`

> - This will create a new branch and make that branch as current working branch

> ### 6. `git branch -d branch-name / git branch -D branch-name`

> - The will delete the branch from local repository & later one will delete the branch forcefully as if it has not been merged then it can't be deleted.

> ### 7. `git push origin --delete branch-name`

> - This will delete the branch from remote repository.

> ### 8. `git checkout main & git merge feature-branch`

> - This will merge the feature branch with main. So on main branch we will have a merge commit. It contains all the code from feature-branch.
> - This will merge the feature branch from local repository not with the remote feature branch. To get the latest from origin we can use either or two below
> - `git pull origin feature-branch` => This will fetch the latest code from feature branch and merge it into current branch(main in our case)
